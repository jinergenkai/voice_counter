## Installation

1. Clone the repository or copy the project files
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
3. Connect your device or start an emulator
4. Run `flutter run`

## How to Use

### Testing Without Voice (Demo Mode)

The app includes test buttons (A and B) in the bottom right corner for testing:
- Press **A** button to add a point to Team A
- Press **B** button to add a point to Team B
- Tap the microphone icon to toggle voice listening state
- Use the settings icon (top right) to access Reset/Pause options

### Setting Up Picovoice Voice Recognition

To enable actual voice commands, you need to:

1. **Get Picovoice Access Key**
   - Sign up at [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/)
   - Get your FREE AccessKey

2. **Create Your Model Files**
   - Create a wake word model (`.ppn`) using Porcupine
   - Create a context model (`.rhn`) using Rhino for commands like:
     - Intent: "addPoint" with slot "team" (values: "A", "B")
   - Download the model files

3. **Add Model Files to App**
   - Copy your `.ppn` and `.rhn` files to `assets/models/` directory
   - Update `lib/services/voice_service.dart`:
     ```dart
     static const String accessKey = 'YOUR_ACTUAL_ACCESS_KEY';
     static const String keywordPath = 'assets/models/your_keyword.ppn';
     static const String contextPath = 'assets/models/your_context.rhn';
     ```

4. **Configure Voice Commands**
   - Design your Rhino context with intents like:
     - "Team A" → adds point to Team A
     - "Team B" → adds point to Team B
     - "One" or "1" → Team A
     - "Two" or "2" → Team B

### Adding Permissions

#### Android (android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml)
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

#### iOS (ios/Runner/Info.plist)
```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs microphone access for voice commands</string>
```
